# wx-event-reliability
Event reliability from multiple weather models with clear plots and LLM/RAG explainers. v1 focuses on precipitation events(rain/snow).

wx-event-reliability estimates how trustworthy a weather event is, not just how big it might be. We compare multiple weather models (via Open-Meteo), compute an Event Reliability Index (ERI), plot model consensus, and explain the “why” with a small physics-backed RAG corpus. v1 focuses on precipitation (rain/snow) for fast, useful results. Next up: temperature, wind, and humidity modules built on the same ERI framework.
